# python-MCQ-quiz
In this project, i have written a code in python for MCQ quiz, where i use various functions like iter, append, print, input as well as i have used for loop and conditional statements.
In the code, first user has to tell wether he/ she is ready for quiz, and then instructions will appear.
every question has 4 choices and user needs to select one option among the 4 options. , also he/ she has the choice to skip the question.
At the end of quiz, total score, percenatge, number of skipped questions, number of correct answers and number of wrong answers comes.
